Very simple table, making first row a header in GFM:

| Orange | Apple     |
|--------|-----------|
| Bread  | Pie       |
| Butter | Ice cream |

Small table, with empty header row in GFM:

|        |           |          |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Orange | Apple     | more     |
| Bread  | Pie       | more     |
| Butter | Ice cream | and more |

The end.
